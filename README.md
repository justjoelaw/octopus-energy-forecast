# Octopus Energy Forecast

This is a project created to refresh my Python and Javascript skills, as well as learn web development with Django and React

Backend: Python and Django Rest Framework
Frontend: Javascript and React
Database: PostgreSQL

The app was previously deployed on Heroku at https://octopus-energy-forecast.herokuapp.com/ - I have now taken this deployment down. The basic functionality of the app can be seen in the gif below:
